I am a third-year computer science student at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM), committed to deepening my expertise in backend development. Currently, I am focused on mastering the Spring framework in Java. This page is designed to share my progress and contributions with the community as I continue my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer.
